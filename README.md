# Data Story on Trends in Recycling and Waste Generation in England
> MSc Coursework Project in COMP6234 Data Visualisation

This project aims to tell a story on the recycling trends and waste generation in the households of England. It demonstrates how much waste we reduce when we recycle and the efforts over the years in England. Datasets related to waste generation and recycling were used to bring insights, and the visualisations were designed according to the principles of narrative design patterns.

The visualisations are produced in D3.js and the layout is designed in CSS and HTML.
